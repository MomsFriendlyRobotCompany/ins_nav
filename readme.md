This library is written independent of any specific IMU. The idea is you pass in the appropriate
measurements and error terms from your IMU and get the desired output.

**This is still under heavy development**

# Install

The suggested way to install this is via the `pip` command as follows::

```
pip install ins_nav
```

## Development

To submit git pulls, clone the repository and set it up as follows::

```
git clone https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/ins_nav
cd ins_nav
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

- `ins_nav.wgs84` contains a bunch of useful constants: semi-major axis, gravity, etc
- `TiltCompensatedCompass` contains the mathematics of an IMU with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers
- `ins_nav.transforms` has a bunch of reference frame conversions: `ecef2llh`, `llh2ecef`, etc
- `ins_nav.errors` has functions to esitmate the horizontal errors given an IMU's bias, mis-alignment, and random walk noise
- `ins_nav.ahrs` creates an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) using accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers

## Todo

- extended kalman filter
- navigation equations
- error model
